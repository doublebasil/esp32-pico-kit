To add the esp32 library to the Arduino IDE, copy the stable release link into
Arduino's preferences tab

Note: Don't "apt install arduino", install it from here: 
https://www.arduino.cc/en/software

You'll find the stable release link on this webpage

https://docs.espressif.com/projects/arduino-esp32/en/latest/installing.html

Then install esp32 by espressif systems using the boards manager

Then sudo apt install python-is-python3 to get rid of the python error

You also need to install esptool using python's pip

sudo apt install python3-pip
sudo python3 pip install esptool

On some models you need to hold the boot or equivalent button, but the 
esp32 pico-d4 does this automatically
